# Bill
A program using JavaFX to create a bill in a pdf format. 
# How To Use It
Open the program in any IDE for example [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) and run it, then add your company name and your products 
then click on **Create** to create a pdf bill format, you can find the pdf file inside the main **bill** folder. 
If you want to read the pdf directly you can click on **Read from file** and a new window will show with information
